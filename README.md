# CppNotes4GMU
A collection of study notes for C++ for Pogrammers in Game Maker's Union at Toronto Metropolitan University

## Disclaimer
- Most of the notes are based off of the material on the Learn C++ site (https://www.learncpp.com/)
  - All notes taken are used for **educational purposes** and taken with materials that are free to use or have adaptations that are free to use. **Please don't sell/distribute these notes for profit or personal gain**.
  - Some notes are from other sources
    - C++ Primer 5th Edition (https://www.amazon.com/Primer-5th-Stanley-B-Lippman/dp/0321714113) or (https://cpp-primer.pages.dev/src/001-contents) ** THIS WILL NOT BE THE CASE UNTIL I GET THROUGH LEARN C++ **
    - Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/) ** Learn C++ redirects here for some niche topics **
  - A few miniscule amount of notes are from my own knowledge, or rather "Common knowledge" in the modern era

The file will be coverted into Markdown after complete
